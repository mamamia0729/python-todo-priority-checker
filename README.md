# To-Do List Priority Checker

## Description

A simple Python command-line tool that allows users to input tasks, assign priorities (high, medium, or low), and view them organized by priority level. This project demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing if statements, for loops, and the enumerate function in Python to develop a practical task management tool.

## Features

* Prompts users to enter the number of tasks and their details.
* Use `for` loops to collect task names and priorities iteratively.
* Employs `enumerate` to number tasks in the output for clarity.
* Applies `if` statements to validate priorities and sets invalid ones to "low".
* Displays tasks grouped by priority (high, medium, low) using `for` loops and `if` statements.

## Skill Demonstration

*  `if statements`: used to validate user-entered priorities, ensuring they are "high", "medium", or "low", and defaulting to "low" for invalid inputs.
*  `for loops`: used to iterate over user inputs for collecting tasks and to display tasks by priority level.
*  `enumerate function`: used to track task indices and display numbered tasks in the output, enhancing readability.
*  `Practical Application`: combines these concepts to solve a real-world task organization problem, demonstrating clear and logical coding.
